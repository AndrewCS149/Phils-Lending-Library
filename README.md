### Description

Phils lending library acts as a virtual book locker where users can store there favorite books.
The user has the ability to view the current 'library'. They can also add books to this library.
If desired, the user can add one of the current books in the library to their 'bookbag'. This 
will remove the book from the library. They can then choose to 'return' the book back to the 
library, which then removes it from their bookbag.
